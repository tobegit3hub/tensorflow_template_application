Serving a TensorFlow Wide & Deep Model (tf.estimator) by TF-Serving in C++

This tutorial builds on the code developed in TensorFlow Wide & Deep Learning Tutorial, so if you haven't yet completed that tutorial, you need to take a look at it first.

This tutorial referenced a python version from https://github.com/MtDersvan/tf_playground/tree/master/wide_and_deep_tutorial.

You'd better take a look at the following proto file first in:
 - tensorflow/core/example/example.proto
 - tensorflow/core/example/feature.proto
 - tensorflow/core/framework/tensor.proto
 - tensorflow_serving/apis/predict.proto
 - tensorflow_serving/apis/model.proto
